Initialize a stack:
    Use a stack to store characters while traversing the input string s.
    
Traverse the input string s character by character:
For each character ch in s:
    If ch is ']':
        Pop characters from the stack until you find '[', forming the decoded substring temp.
        Discard the '[' character from the stack.
        Next, extract the number preceding the '[', which tells how many times to repeat the substring. This number could be multi-digit:
            Pop digits from the stack (as characters), convert them into an integer a.
        Repeat the substring temp a times and push the repeated result back onto the stack.

    If ch is not ']':
        Push the character ch onto the stack.

Final construction:
    Once the traversal of s is complete, pop all the characters left in the stack and build the final decoded string by appending them in the correct order.

Return the final decoded string.
